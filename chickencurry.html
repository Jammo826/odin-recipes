   <h2>How would you describe a chicken curry?</h2>
   <p>A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chilli peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and cardamom.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients list</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>1 small onion, sliced</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon plus 1/3 cup water, divided</li>
       <li>1/2 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
       <li>1 small apple, peeled and chopped</li>
       <li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
       <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
       <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
       <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
       <li>1-1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules</li>
       <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
       <li>3/4 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon thinly sliced green onion</li>
       <li>Hot cooked rice</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>So how do we make it?</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>Place onion and 1 tablespoon water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover and microwave on high until crisp-tender, 1 to 1-1/2 minutes.</li>
       <li>In a 1-1/2-qt. slow cooker, combine the chicken, apple, raisins, garlic, curry, ginger, salt and onion. Combine the flour, bouillon and remaining water; pour over chicken mixture. Cover and cook on low until chicken juices run clear, 3 to 3-1/2 hours.</li>
       <li>Bring sour cream to room temperature. Remove chicken mixture to a bowl; keep warm. Transfer juices to a small saucepan. Combine cornstarch and sour cream until smooth; add to juices. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened. Pour over chicken mixture; toss to coat. Sprinkle with green onion and serve with rice.</li>
   </ol>
