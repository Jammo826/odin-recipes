  <h2>What are Peanut Butter Cookies?</h2>
  <p>A peanut butter cookie is a type of cookie that is distinguished for having peanut butter as a principal ingredient. The cookie originated in the United States, its development dating back to the 1910s. If crunchy peanut butter is used, the resulting cookie may contain peanut fragments.</p>
<h3>What you will need:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All-purpose flour – this base builds up the structure of the cookies.</li>
    <li>Baking soda and baking powder – these are crucial as they help the cookies to rise.</li>
    <li>Salt – we don’t add that much because there’s already salt in the peanut butter.</li>
    <li>Unsalted butter – salted butter can be used too, just omit the 1/4 tsp salt from the recipe.</li>
    <li>Granulated sugar and brown sugar – this blend gives the cookies the perfect sweetness and the brown sugar helps keep them soft.</li>
    <li>Creamy peanut butter – I recommend using Jif or Skippy.</li>
    <li>Egg – this helps bind the ingredients together, you’ll only need 1 here.</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract – this adds that light, classic flavor we all love. Preferably stick with the real stuff not imitation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lets make them!</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven, prepare baking sheet: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 18 by 13-inch baking sheets with silicone baking liners or parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Whisk dry ingredients: In a medium mixing bowl whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Cream butter and sugars: In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment cream together butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until combined.</li>
    <li>Mix in peanut butter then blend in egg and vanilla.</li>
    <li>Blend flour mixture into butter mixture: With mixer set on low speed slowly add in flour mixture and mix just until combined.</li>
    <li>Scoop and shape: Scoop dough out and roll into balls (30 grams each or nearly 2 Tbsp) then place on baking sheets spacing them 2-inches apart.</li>
    <li>Flatten with a fork: Using a long pronged fork flatten cookies slightly then turn fork going opposite direction and flatten just slightly again (it should create that criss cross pattern).</li>
    <li>Bake cookies in preheated oven, one sheet at a time, for about 9 minutes (cookies will appear pale and slightly under-baked, they’ll continue to cook slightly as they cool).</li>
    <li>Cool: Let cool on baking sheet 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store cookies and an airtight container.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
